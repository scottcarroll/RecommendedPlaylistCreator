# RecommendedPlaylistCreator
Personal project which creates a spotify playlist of songs related to user's most favorite artists

Created by Scott Carroll


This program allows you to create custom playlists for users based on their listening habits!
When you run this project it will first ask you for your spotify id and your spotify developer client details.

After this you will be asked a few basic questions about how you want your playlist modelled (Song count, familiarity level, etc...).

This was my first project working with the spotify API. If you have any suggestions or improvements please make a pull request!
